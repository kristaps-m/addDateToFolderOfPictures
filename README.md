# addDateToFolderOfPictures
Hi,
I like develop digital pictures to actual physical photograph which I can put in an album. And also I like the exact or approximate date on the picture when it was created. So I created Python code to do that for me. What takes human hours is done in seconds for computer.
You will need Python on your machine. And simple google search how to run Python code.
And do not forget to edit the starting folder in code line 62 and destination folder in code line 68.

In future, I would like to refactor the code so variables and all code is more clear to the regular user.
